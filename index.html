            <p>
                i'm a complete newbie in web development, but i'm actively learning and eager to learn more. 

                web development attracts me because for some reason i find coding a fun thing to do - especially when i can immediatly see the result, and it's interactive.
                
                why do i think i can become a good developer? because i hate so many sites across the internet, and i want to be the change i want to see in the world.
                
                in long term, i aim to become a full-stack developer - but that's later, let me get a handle on front-end first.

                english: C2, according to EF SET, but it only tested my reading and listening skills. i guess my writing is somewhere around B2, and speaking is unknown because i don't get many opportunities to speak english. better get ready for my strong russian accent.
